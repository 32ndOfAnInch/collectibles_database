Unattractive, dull or washed-out, mint luster typify this coin. 
There may be many large detracting contact marks (bag nicks), or damage spots, but absolutely no trace of wear. 
There could be a heavy concentration of hairlines (minute scratches to a coinâ€™s surface), or unattractive large areas of scuff-marks. 
Rim nicks may be present, and eye appeal is very poor. Copper coins may be dark, dull and spotted.
