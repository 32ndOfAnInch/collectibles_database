                    <h3>Circulation Coins</h3>
                    <p>Circulation coins are coins issued by a state. They can be used to pay at any time without a problem 
                        - provided that they aren't old coins that lost their status as legal tender.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Banknotes</h3>
                    <p>A banknote is a type of negotiable promissory note, 
                        made by a bank or other licensed authority, payable to the bearer on demand.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Commemorative Coins</h3>
                    <p>A commemorative coin is a coin issued to commemorate some particular event 
                        or issue with a distinct design with reference to the occasion on which they were issued.</p>
                    <p>Many coins of this category serve as collector's items only, 
                        although some countries also issue commemorative coins for regular circulation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Circulating Commemoratives</h3>
                    <p>Circulating commemoratives are intended to be used for commerce, 
                        but the design will only be issued for a limited time to commemorate an event, 
                        anniversary, person or location, among other items.</p>
                    <p>Examples include the â‚¬2 commemorative coins and U.S. 50 State Quarters.</p>

                    <h3>Collector Coins</h3>
                    <p>Collector coins, also known as numismatic coins, 
                        are specially minted coins that are sought after and collected for their rarity, 
                        historical significance, artistic design, or other unique qualities.</p>
                    <p>Unlike regular circulation coins used in everyday transactions, 
                        collector coins are primarily intended for numismatists, coin enthusiasts, and collectors.</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>Bullion Coins</h3>
                    <p>Bullion coins are a specific type of coin that is 
                        primarily valued for its precious metal content rather than its rarity or numismatic qualities.</p>
